Currently working as an Android devoper with Kotlin

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m JosÃ© Gellida


*You'll only see android projects, that's because I was focused on mobile development *

what you will see in this github account.

-Some android fundamentals like *lifecycle, corutines and reyclerview*
-then, some more useful tools like *Activites, Fragments, Constrain layout, shared preferences*
-*firebase*
-I work with *MVVM* (only in mobile development)


one of my main goals is to work with Docker, Web sockets, and AI

- :books:One of my hobbys right now is to get better in my second lenguage. Actually reading Clean Code and Head First Dessign Patterns.
